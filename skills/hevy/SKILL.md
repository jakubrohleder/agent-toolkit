  Create and edit workout routines in the Hevy fitness app via API. User-invocable with /hevy.

  Use when: (1) User wants to create a Hevy routine from a training plan or description,
  (2) User asks to add exercises to Hevy, (3) User mentions "hevy routine" or similar,
  (4) User shares a training program (text, PDF, image) to convert to Hevy format,
  (5) User wants to edit, update, or rename an existing Hevy routine,
  (6) User asks how to use the Hevy API or about routine structure.

  Triggers: "/hevy", "create hevy routine", "add to hevy", "hevy workout",
  "training plan to hevy", "convert workout", "exercise routine", "edit hevy",
  "update routine", "hevy api", "modify workout", "gym routine", "gym program",

# Hevy Routine Creator

**Before starting**: The Hevy API is fragile. Small mistakes (wrong field, `@` in notes, missing wrapper) cause silent failures. Follow this skill exactly—shortcuts cause debugging pain.

## Workflow

1. Parse workout plan - extract exercises, sets, reps, weights, rest times
2. **MANDATORY: Read `references/api-reference.md`** before ANY API call
   - Contains critical quirks that cause silent failures
   - Do NOT skip the "API Quirks" section
3. Map exercises to IDs (see decision tree below)
   **Do NOT load** `exercises-by-category.md` until actively mapping names to IDs.
   Search tip: Ctrl+F by muscle group header (e.g., `## quadriceps`).
4. **MANDATORY: Read `references/routine-examples.md`** for JSON structure
5. Create via `scripts/hevy-api`

**Do NOT load** all references upfront - load as needed per step.

## NEVER Do

- **NEVER** call the Hevy API directly - always use `scripts/hevy-api` which handles authentication
- **NEVER** use `@` in notes fields - causes silent Bad Request (HTML response)
- **NEVER** forget to wrap routine: `{"routine": {...}}` not just `{...}`
- **NEVER** include read-only fields in PUT:
  - `routine.id`, `routine.folder_id`, `routine.created_at`, `routine.updated_at`
  - `exercises[].index`, `exercises[].title`
  - `sets[].index`
- **NEVER** mismatch set properties and exercise type (see `quick-reference.md` for table):
  - `weight_reps` → `weight_kg`, `reps`
  - `reps_only` → `reps` only (no weight!)
  - `duration` → `duration_seconds`
  - `distance_duration` → `distance_meters`, `duration_seconds`
- **NEVER** set `rest_seconds` on first exercise of superset (only last gets rest)
- **NEVER** use `pageSize` > 10 for `/v1/routine_folders`
- **NEVER** assume exercise name matches exactly - search by keyword, verify ID against `exercises-by-category.md`
- **NEVER** create custom exercise without first searching partial name variations (e.g., "Squat" not just "Back Squat")
- **NEVER** guess exercise IDs - always verify against reference files or API response

**Note:** The `notes` field is optional—can be omitted entirely or set to empty string `""`.

## Parsing Workout Plans

Before building JSON, think through:
- **Goal**: Strength (low rep, high weight), hypertrophy (moderate rep), or conditioning (high rep/time)?
- **Structure**: Are exercises grouped (supersets/circuits) or sequential with rest?
- **Ambiguity**: What's implicit? Missing weights = leave empty. Missing rest = use 90s default.

Then map the details:

**What type of set?**
| Input Pattern | Set Type | Notes |
|---------------|----------|-------|
| "Warmup", "warm up", "build up" | `"type": "warmup"` | Not counted in working sets |
| "5x5", "3x10", working sets | `"type": "normal"` | Standard working set |
| "AMRAP", "max reps", "test", "to failure" | `"reps": null` | Leave reps open |
| "Drop set" | `"type": "dropset"` | Reduced weight continuation |

**Superset or sequential?**
- "A1/A2", "superset", "paired with", "alternate with" - same `superset_id` (use integers: 0, 1, 2...)
- "Circuit" or "EMOM" - all exercises share one `superset_id`
- Separate exercises with rest between - `superset_id: null`

**Rest timing interpretation:**
- Hevy tracks rest per-exercise, not per-set
- "90s rest between sets" - `rest_seconds: 90`
- For supersets: rest goes on LAST exercise only
- "No rest" or "immediately" - `rest_seconds: 0`

**Weight interpretation:**
- Always use `weight_kg` (Hevy converts for display)
- "bodyweight" exercises - typically `reps_only` type, no weight field
- "BW + 20kg" - use `bodyweight_weighted` exercise variant

**Before creating custom exercise, ask:**
- Did I search partial names? (e.g., "row" finds 15+ variations)
- Did I check equipment variants? (Barbell, Dumbbell, Cable, Machine, Smith)
- Could it exist under a different name? ("Skull Crushers" = "Lying Tricep Extension")
- Is this genuinely missing from Hevy's 400+ built-in exercises?

If all yes → create custom. Otherwise, use the existing match.

## Exercise ID Lookup

```
User input (e.g., "squat")
    ↓
Search quick-reference.md (common exercises)
    ↓ Found? → Use ID
    ↓ Not found
Search exercises-by-category.md (partial match, check muscle group)
    ↓ Found? → Use ID
    ↓ Multiple matches? → Ask user: "Squat (Barbell), Squat (Machine), or Goblet Squat?"
    ↓                     If no response: Barbell > Dumbbell > Machine > Bodyweight
    ↓ Not found
Check ~/.hevy/custom-exercises.md
    ↓ Found? → Use ID
    ↓ Not found
Fetch from API: scripts/hevy-api GET '/v1/exercise_templates?page=1&pageSize=100'
    ↓ Found? → Cache to ~/.hevy/custom-exercises.md, use ID
    ↓ Not found
Create custom exercise (ONLY after confirming no similar exists)
```

## Bulk Operations (Multi-Week Programs)

For programs with many routines (e.g., 12-week plan):

1. **Create folder first** - Group routines logically
2. **Process in batches** - Create 3-5 routines, verify success, continue. Wait 2-3s between calls to avoid rate limits.
3. **Use consistent naming** - `T{week} {day} - {description}` (e.g., "T1 Mon - Upper")
4. **Track progress** - Note created routine IDs in case of partial failure
5. **If one fails** - Fix and retry that routine only; don't restart the batch

## Pre-Submission Validation

**MANDATORY before any POST/PUT:**

1. **Exercise IDs exist** - Every `exercise_template_id` verified against `exercises-by-category.md` or custom cache
2. **Set properties match type** - Cross-check against table in NEVER section
3. **No `@` in notes** - Search JSON for `@` symbol, replace with "at"
4. **Wrapper present** - JSON is `{"routine": {...}}` not bare object
5. **No read-only fields** (for PUT) - Remove `id`, `folder_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `index`, `title`
6. **Superset rest correct** - Only last exercise in superset has `rest_seconds > 0`

If validation fails, fix before proceeding. Do NOT attempt API call with known issues.

## API Access

Use `scripts/hevy-api` for all API calls:
```bash
scripts/hevy-api GET /v1/routines                          # List routines
scripts/hevy-api GET /v1/routine_folders                   # List folders
scripts/hevy-api POST /v1/routines .tmp-hevy/routine.json  # Create routine
scripts/hevy-api PUT /v1/routines/<id> .tmp-hevy/routine.json
scripts/rename-routine.sh <id> "New Title"                 # Rename helper
```

**JSON files:** Write to `.tmp-hevy/`, validate, then clean up:
```bash
mkdir -p .tmp-hevy
# write JSON to .tmp-hevy/routine.json
jq . .tmp-hevy/routine.json >/dev/null && scripts/hevy-api POST /v1/routines .tmp-hevy/routine.json
rm -rf .tmp-hevy
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| HTML response / Bad Request | `@` in notes | Replace with "at" or remove |
| "field not allowed" on PUT | Read-only field included | Remove fields per NEVER list above |
| Exercise not found | Typo or custom exercise | Search partial name, check customs, create if needed |
| Empty response | Wrong pagination | Check `page_count`, use correct `pageSize` |
| Folder not found | Wrong folder_id | Fetch current folders: `scripts/hevy-api GET /v1/routine_folders` |

**If API call fails:**
1. Check response for error message
2. Verify JSON structure against routine-examples.md
3. Test with minimal routine (1 exercise, 1 set) to isolate issue

**Error recovery:**
- **500 error**: Wait 30s, retry once. If persists, API is down.
- **429 rate limit**: Wait 60s before retry. Batch operations slower.
- **401 unauthorized**: Check `~/.hevy/.api_key` exists and has no quotes/whitespace.
- **Partial success** (some routines created, some failed): Note successful IDs, fix failed JSON, continue.

**For complex failures:** Read `references/api-reference.md#error-recovery`
